      " 26,000 to 18,500 were killed by artillery fire during the following 17 days.       It was believed that the heaviest shelling on 18 July came from the 3rd Battalion, 26th Firing Troops, a reserve unit assigned to a supply route in northwest Morocco during the battle.  Two weeks later, in September, one of three tanks of the 6th Tank Corps, under the command of Maj.       W. H. Williams III, attempted a deep penetration-pointing-missile, which was turned away by the target vehicle.  Two months later, in October of the same year, two additional tanks from the 4-1/2th Division, under the command of Maj. Gen. B. L. Fowle, under heavy artillery fire, engaged the 26th Division artillery during a day-long bombardment of the southwest.  The enemy was engaged in one intense action for 10 minutes.  The tank crew lost five men.  They returned to base after 14 hours, and the tank was returned to service a few days later.  One tank crewman was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, and the other three had their vehicles and their equipment returned safely to France.  Two tanks from the 6th and one from the 4-1/2nd Divisions were damaged by a bomb dropped by U- boats on 12 March 1944, when they attempted an attempt to destroy a German aircraft carrier.  During the raid, the U-boats were fired upon, and an officer of the destroyer crew was killed.  Another tank crew took part in several other \"siege\" raids during the following year.  Five of a crew of 30 were killed by enemy fire during 12 June 1944; two others were blown to pieces.  Several tanks from five tank units from the 4-1/2th Divisions were damaged by gunfire during an attack by 10 T-34 tanks on 17 June 1944.  One crewman was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions.  Three tanks of the 3rd Armored Division were tanked during an enemy raid on 4 June 1944. Two tankers were killed.  Ten more M1A1 gunners were killed during 12 separate tanks, truck, and airplane attacks over 4 days between 4 April and 5 July 1944.  One M1A1 crewman was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions.  One M4A1 tank and one M6A1 gunner were lost when one M4A1 was hit by an enemy shell and caught fire on the right side.  One M20A1 crewman, with two crewmen of the 29th Tank Battalion, lost his life while attempting to stop a convoy of 6 German vehicles under pursuit on 23 June 1944.  One crewman was killed during a 7-day firefight near Wounded Knee, California, during which three tanks and a supply train were destroyed.  One crew from the 8th and 45th Infantry Divisions of the 30th Infantry Division lost an M23 gun gun battery during a 4-day battle over 3 days in 2 February 1945.  One platoon with a platoon of 3nd Battalion (2d Infantry Division), 8th Armored Cavalry Company, on a patrol in France, lost a 2 day time battle during 3-4 June 1944.  One tank crewman with the 2d Tank Battalion of the 21st Marines (1st Marine Division), during an assault on a strong point near Bessarabia, France, lost one officer and 3 enlisted men.  One crewman, Maj. E. G. Brown, died after falling off of a tank and being hit by a mortar shell while making a roll dive in an 8-10 p.m. attack on a road.  One crewman was killed during a 6-day ambush. Two M1A1 gunners lost their lives during a 3-day patrol against a group of enemy forces east of the village of Monton (France) during 2 March 1945.  One crewman was killed during a 4-day firefight.  One M16A2 gunner was killed during a 3-day assault on the village of Montleuze (France) during a 2-day patrol.  Two crewmen from the 44th Tank Battalion, under the command of Lt. C. H. Minkiewicz and Maj. N. K. Jahn, lost their lives during a 5-day counterattacks through a forest during a 3-day patrol into Germany in mid- March 1945.  One tank crew officer lost their life during an 8-9 p.m. counterattack in France (3 July 1945.)  One tank crewman suffered a broken arm from having his helmet and radio gear blown in the 10-15 miles southeast of the French port city of Caen.  One M1A2 gunner was killed during a 19-minute firefight during a 3-day infantry raid in France on 16 June 1944\n",

One bright white object flew very fast, straight and level as it flew, for 4-5 seconds.  It made an abrupt right turn to the left, then to the right with a tremendous roar.  Sighting lasted 2-3 minutes.  No further details are known.   49-56 March 1953; St. Lous, Louisiana. 6.4 a.m. Witness: USAF pilot involved in aerial observation.  One oval-shaped object, as dark as a pinhead, with a dark rim and a white light rimmed with a bright white light, hovered above a highway for an estimated 5 minutes. Sighting lasted 10 minutes.   50-60? July 1953?; Bermuda. 1 a.m. Witness: radar trackers.  One elliptical object with a thin, funnel-shaped area in the middle, hovered, bobbed and flew erratically during a 6 hour period.   51-54 April 1954; near San Antonio, Texas. 9:20 p.m. Witnesses: USAF AC&W radar operators in a patrol plane.  One long cylinder with a dome at one end and no exhaust like the exhausts of other mid-sized light aircraft, hovered for 3-4 seconds over an airfield and a few miles away.  After a little while, it turned and flew away very fast toward the north.   55-60 July 1954?; Bermuda. l0 p.m. Witness: Lt. Col. S.V. Jones of USAF AC&W.  One bright light which blinked at times, followed a patrol plane flying low at 150-160 kts.  Several airplanes were disturbed during the 30 minute observation.   Witness: a civilian.  Sighting lasted 5 minutes. 62-70? July 1954??; east of Guam. Two objects with flashing lights. 9:15 p.m. Witness: USAF radar operators in a C-47 transport plane.  One light turned red then green and moved away during the 30 minute observation.   77 April 1956; Willsboro, Wisconsin. 1 a.m. witness: W.H. Lindner, M.A. aeronautical engineering student. One orange, white and blue light moved from west to north, zigzagged and sped away at more than 3,000 m.p.h.   72-77 December 1956; Langley AFB, Virginia. 2:55 p.m. Witnesses: USAF Lt. Col. J.A. Stahl and Maj. D.B. Smith at control tower. One yellow light flew straight and level, hovered, then flew very fast.                                                              32 files turned up ; some of which showed strange behavior. 27 files made several strange jerky turns, some of them very fast, others very slowly. 28 files flew at 400 m.p.h. for several minutes each. March 27, 1963?; at Toulouse, France. 2:30 or 3:15 a.m. Witness: French farmer, flying a Beech T-wing monoplane.  One yellow light circled and flew rapidly in a fast-moving V-formation, which slowed as it flew away, during the 60 minute observation.       June 23, 1963; near Chiappet, North Carolina. 4 p.m. Witness: A/2c E.E. McKean. Two green lights flew in tight formation, very fast when turned around.  Case lost with 6 radar stops. June 24, 1963??; near Albuquerque, New Mexico. 9:30 p.m. Witnesses: S/2d Lt. Hart and two others.  One bright orange light flew straight and level during an 8 minute observation.  Case not returned, may have gone to the bottom of the ocean. July 6, 1963; near Grand Rapids, Michigan. 1 a.m. Witness?: W.Y. Linville (son of USMC veteran Maj. S\\2d Lt. Linville). During an aerial reconnaissance mission, a metallic object flew like a plane for several minutes.  Case lost with 2 more reports at night in late 1953. July 23, 1963, at Corvallis, Oregon??; 3 p.m. Witness: E.J. Stahl. A group of 5 lights hovered for 20 minutes. Sighting lasted 5 minutes.  Case returned to original owner from a shipyard.

    "You can also pass in a `prefix` to the generate function to force the text to start with a given character sequence and generate text from there (good if you add an indicator when the text starts).\n",

    "You can also generate multiple texts at a time by specifing `nsamples`. Unique to GPT-2, you can pass a `batch_size` to generate multiple samples in parallel, giving a massive speedup (in Colaboratory, set a maximum of 20 for `batch_size`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other optional-but-helpful parameters for `gpt2.generate` and friends:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **`length`**: Number of tokens to generate (default 1023, the maximum)\n",
    "* **`temperature`**: The higher the temperature, the crazier the text (default 0.7, recommended to keep between 0.7 and 1.0)\n",
    "* **`top_k`**: Limits the generated guesses to the top *k* guesses (default 0 which disables the behavior; if the generated output is super crazy, you may want to set `top_k=40`)\n",
    "* **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling: limits the generated guesses to a cumulative probability. (gets good results on a dataset with `top_p=0.9`)\n",
    "* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n",
